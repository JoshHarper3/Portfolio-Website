            <p class="about-p"> My name is Josh Harper, and I am a 19 year old Digital Media Student at UWE Bristol, originally from South Devon but based in Bristol. 
              I am an aspiring Web Designer and have gained a range of skills and experiences through studying a wide array of different IT and Graphic Design modules
              through my current BSc in Digital Media. These include Web/Graphic Design, Animation and modelling in Maya, Video Game Design and production in Unity, and Creative Coding with p5.js.
              I have also built a solid foundation of IT Skills through my BTECs in Information Technology both at GCSE and A level alongside traditional GCSES and A Levels. 
              Outside of work, I really enjoy watching films, sports and walking outside! Please donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch and look forward to hearing from you!</p>

               activity as well as a positive body movement planner and step tracker that aims to motivate the user to engage in more frequent phsyical activity. 
               The app design choices were informed by an initial stage of user research were six different university students were interviewed about their physical activity levels and 
               potential barriers to engaging in physical activity.  </p>

                Through making this artwork I learned skills in p5 javascript, for example, how to make use

                I used contrasting colours, speeds and sizes for the different ellipses which also helped to create a visually

                that took inputs from the Arduino that enabled the user to change the pitch of each note in an eight note sequence by using buttons to change the selected note and a slider
                to change the pitch of the note. The product was designed for the target audience of young children so the interactions are deliberately simple and easy to understand. 
                This project taught me valuable technical skills in physical computing as well as key interaction design skills such as how to design a product for a specific target audience.

            <p class="media-p">This animation is about homophobia in men's football and was done in Adobe After Affects. All of the assets 
              in the animation were produced in Adobe Illustrator, which taught me valuable skills in graphic design. Overall this animation taught me 
              key animation and graphic design skills and furthered my knowledge of the Adobe suite.

              <p class="principles-p">This is an Interactive Pirate Expereince that I made in Unity using some Maya modelled elements.
                Throughout this process I learned important skills such as how to use C# code in Unity to produce an environment full of objects and areas that a user can interact with.
                I also gained experience in 3D modelling in Maya as I modelled a Starfruit, Tankard and Chest which all feature in my interactive experience. Overall I gained key experience in 
                workflow between Maya and Unity and skills in how to make a fun and engaging interactive experience for the user.

              <p class="principles-p">This is an interactive Virtual Reality horror experience made for the Oculus Quest 2 using Unity's VR Core with code in C#. It features a child's bedroom which I modelled myself using Maya (visual assets from Unity Asset Store, Sketchfab and Mixamo)
                and a scary NPC that appears at various points in the experience. It also features creepy sound effects and scary animations that amplify the suspense and horror of the experience. 
                Many assets in the experience are interactable and can be picked up by the user, similarly the night light can be turned on and off by the user, and specific objects like the teddy bear can despawn the scary 
                NPC when picked up. The project enhanced my Unity scripting skills as well as my game/interaction design abilities.

            <p class="principles-p">This is a 3D Model of the Iron Giant that I modelled and textured in Maya.
              Through making this I learned valuable 3D Modelling skills in Maya such as how to construct a visually interesting model using a mixture of different shapes and extrusions.
              I also gained experience in texturing and lighting in Maya which greatly helped to make my model more dynamic and visually striking.
